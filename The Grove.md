> [!tldr]- About
> These are the #evergreen pieces - #long-form completed works that stand on their own. This space may stand somewhat empty for a time and that's by design. Until then I plan to show where I think things might be starting to come together by using the space to call out a thematic heading and the writing that seems connected.

## Grove Collection

*Mature works will appear here as they're established*, while the idea is that these will be largely unchanging, I expect I'll refer back to them in later work. Moreover,  [you can never step in the same river twice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclitus) and these pieces will undoubtedly shed a few leaves that will help things grow in the rest of the garden. 

Notes in the grove represent completed thinking. While they may receive occasional maintenance updates, they're considered #evergreen and relatively stable. These pieces can be cited, referenced, and built upon.
