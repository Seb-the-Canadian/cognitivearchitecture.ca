## The Work

This is my space for thinking out loud about AI, technology adoption, and organizational change—testing ideas, applying different lenses, and figuring out how to keep humanity at the centre of increasingly complex technological landscapes.

I'm particularly interested in questions that get skipped in fast-moving tech conversations: How do we maintain human judgment while leveraging artificial intelligence? What does sustainable innovation actually look like? How do we honor both technical possibility and the messy reality of how people work?

This is also a portfolio space—a way to showcase approaches I think are different, important, and hopefully valuable to others navigating similar challenges.

## The Perspective

I work at the intersection of data strategy, AI enablement, and organizational systems thinking. Currently building sustainable approaches to AI adoption while exploring how we can use technology to create more thoughtful, connected communities.

My background studying how marginalized populations navigate institutional systems—from library policies affecting homeless patrons to youth homelessness services—shapes how I think about technology adoption. The most thoughtful questions about AI and data governance often come from people who understand that systems are more than their technical components.

I write from experience bridging research with implementation across learning and development, organizational change management, and data governance. This work has taught me that technical solutions succeed or fail based on how well they integrate with how people actually work.

## The Approach

**Testing ideas** rather than declaring solutions. I'm working through frameworks and approaches, seeing what holds up when applied to real challenges.

**Different perspective** on familiar problems. My background studying how marginalized people navigate systems gives me a particular lens on technology adoption that I think is worth exploring.

**Systems thinking** over isolated solutions. Every technical choice has consequences that shape what can be expressed and how it can be understood.

## What You'll Find

**Essays** exploring AI collaboration, digital sovereignty, and organizational transformation—polished thinking on questions I've been working through.

**Case studies** from learning design and data governance work, focusing on what actually works in practice.

**Frameworks** I'm developing for navigating technological adoption decisions.

**Knowledge systems** design and personal tooling approaches that honor complexity and divergent perspectives.

---
## Intended Audience

Knowledge workers, learning professionals, and organizational development practitioners who find themselves asking thoughtful questions about sustainable technology implementation. If technology conversations feel like they move too fast or skip important human considerations, this space is designed with your perspective in mind.

This digital garden embodies its own principles through its implementation. Every technical choice, every architectural decision, every piece of documentation reflects the values and beliefs that shape the content itself.

>[!network] Systems Aren't Neutral
>- **Content structure reflects values**: Growth stages prioritize evolution over completion
>- **Technical choices have consequences**: Every tool choice shapes what can be expressed
>- **Architecture as philosophy**: The system design embodies epistemic humility

> [!Warning]- Disclaimer
> This is work in progress in the best sense—ideas I'm testing and refining, frameworks I'm developing through real application, perspectives I'm exploring systematically. The essays represent more polished thinking, while the overall project evolves through engagement with actual challenges. Consider it a working portfolio of how I approach complex problems.
