# Cognitive Architecture

"Cognitive architecture" is the guiding idea for this site: the intentional design of systems that help humans and machines think together. Rather than replacing human judgment, the goal is to amplify wisdom, create resilient knowledge practices, and sustain agency in a quickly changing technological landscape.

This note will grow into a map of the principles, frameworks, and experiments that define the practice. For now it offers a quick set of anchors:

- **Human-centered design**: start from the lived experience of people navigating complex systems.
- **Knowledge stewardship**: treat data, stories, and insights as shared resources that need tending.
- **Augmented intelligence**: pair machine capabilities with reflective human processes.
- **Ethical scaffolding**: ensure governance, accountability, and care are present at every layer.
