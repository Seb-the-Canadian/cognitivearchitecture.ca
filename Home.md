# Welcome to Cognitive Architecture

Hello. 

I’m [[About me|Sebastian]] and this is my [[digital garden]]. It may not look like much yet - but trust me, there's lots under the surface.

Here, I'll be exploring the intersection of knowledge, work and AI—testing ideas, applying different lenses, and figuring out how to keep humanity at the centre of increasingly complex technological landscapes. [[About the site|This won't always happen in a straight line]].

## Navigation

>Follow the embedded [wikilinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki#Linking_to_and_naming_pages) to explore interconnected ideas and notes. Since this concept isn't typical (but I do think it's quite intuitive once you start trying it) I also want there to be some areas for particular content.
### Garden Gates + Paths

#### _Garden gates are more traditional or official entry points._

>[!example] Gates
>[[Home]]
>_This is where you are right now. It's the main landing page for the site._
>[[The Grove]]
>_This is where I'll store longer-form writing as it emerges. Think of it like the core 'publication' piece of the garden._
>[[The Greenhouse]]
>_My professional portfolio, consulting philosophy, and case-studies._
>[[The Shed]]
>_This is where I'll keep tools and frameworks that I find useful for the kind of work I do. These will be one's I've picked up from others and some that I've put together myself._

>[!example] Paths
_Garden paths are maps, trails, and stepping stones that will emerge over time. These will generally follow common themes._
