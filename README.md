# Cognitive Architecture Publish Vault

This repository contains the Obsidian vault that powers [cognitive-architecture.ca](https://cognitive-architecture.ca). It is structured as a public knowledge garden exploring the intersections of AI, organizational change, and human-centred systems design.

## Contents
- `Home.md`: Landing page and welcome
- `The Greenhouse.md`: Active projects and case studies
- `The Grove.md`: Evergreen, long-form writing
- `The Shed.md`: Works in progress and experiments
- `Meta/`: Operational notes, site attachments, and alignment resources
- `publish.css`: Custom styling overrides for Obsidian Publish

## Getting Started
1. Open the vault in Obsidian.
2. Ensure the theme matches the live site (current setup assumes default Obsidian dark/light with custom CSS overrides).
3. Enable `publish.css` for both local preview (via CSS snippets) and Obsidian Publish to keep parity.

## Publishing Workflow
1. Draft content in the appropriate section (Greenhouse, Grove, Shed).
2. Update frontmatter metadata (`status`, `tags`, `created`, `last tended`).
3. Review the [Publish Alignment Plan](Meta/Operations/Publish%20Alignment%20Plan.md) to confirm pre-publish checks.
4. Use Obsidian Publish to push updates, verifying callouts, media, and navigation links post-deploy.

## Additional Resources
- `Meta/Operations/Publish Alignment Plan.md`: Step-by-step checklist for keeping the site in line with Obsidian Publish best practices.
- `Meta/Tag Glossary.md`: Canonical tag definitions used across the site.
- `Meta/99_Archive/`: Retired or reference material not currently published.
