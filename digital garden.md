# Digital garden

A digital garden is a personal knowledge space that embraces ongoing growth instead of final publication. Notes can be added, pruned, and linked over time, allowing ideas to mature in public view.

This site follows that philosophy: pages can be in different stages of development, wikilinks connect related thinking, and visitors are encouraged to explore rather than follow a strict hierarchy. For more on the broader approach, see [[About the site]].
