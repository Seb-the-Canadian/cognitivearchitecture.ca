>[!tldr] What I'm building
> A practice that helps people, entrepreneurs, small businesses, and organizations reclaim their relationship with digital tools and data—moving from dependency and extraction toward sovereignty and genuine capability.
## More about my professional practice

I'm interested in how people and organizations build the capacity to navigate digital change wisely—not just adopt new tools, but develop the clarity and infrastructure to think through what these technologies mean for how they work, decide, and create value.

My thinking draws on systems analysis, adult learning principles, and philosophical inquiry to examine questions that surface when digital tools move from exciting possibility to daily reality. 

I don't assume digital adoption is inherently good, or that resistance signals a problem. I'm interested in what you're actually optimizing for, the tensions between efficiency and agency, and how to build change practices grounded in how people genuinely learn—not how we wish they would.

My background brings together enterprise learning design, organizational change facilitation, and academic grounding in sociology and systems thinking. I've spent 7+ years inside digital transformation efforts at scale, but I'm increasingly interested in how these insights apply to individuals and smaller organizations—contexts where you can't outsource thinking to a strategy team or wait for enterprise-level solutions.

## Why you might want to work with me

Most approaches to digital transformation focus on implementation: which tools to use, how to train people, how to measure adoption. I'm trying to build foundations on a deeper level; the cognitive and cultural infrastructure that determines whether digital change actually serves your goals—or just creates sophisticated ways to do the wrong things faster.

The question isn't just "which AI tool should I use" or "how do I implement this platform"—it's "how do I build digital and data infrastructure that preserves my agency, serves my actual goals, and doesn't lock me into systems designed to extract value while limiting my autonomy?"

My focus is on helping individuals, entrepreneurs, and small teams develop:

- Data fluency that enables clear thinking about what information matters and why
- Low-friction approaches to digital infrastructure that prioritize portability over vendor lock-in
- Sustainable practices for working with emerging tools without surrendering control
- Frameworks for thinking about data sovereignty in practical, implementable terms

Whether you're a creative professional figuring out how AI fits into your practice, an entrepreneur building tech infrastructure for a growing team, or a small business leader navigating digital change—the core challenge is similar: how do you adopt digital capability in ways that enhance rather than erode your autonomy?

If you're committed to building digital and data practices that work for you—not just adopting whatever's trending or accepting platform dependency as inevitable—I'd welcome the conversation. I'm looking to learn from people navigating these tensions across different contexts, especially those willing to question conventional wisdom about how digital transformation "should" work.
