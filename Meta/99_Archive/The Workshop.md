If you’re reading this it’s because you did some digging! 

When I first published this site I had a different concept of how it would be set up. Since the inspiration to begin this project was to create something that would give me an outlet to write down my ideas, but also act something like a portfolio, I initially overshot the “garden” concept. 

This note is a remnant of that first attempt. 

Instead of getting rid of it, it’s still here, just not visible unless you find it by clicking through like you just did!

# About the Workshop

Living documents that grow and change. These are active thoughts, questions, and explorations - ideas in their most fresh and experimental form. This is a space for tinkering & testing.

## What's here

- Emerging insights and connections
- Questions under investigation  
- Early-stage concept development
- Raw observations and notes

## Workshop Notes

*New writing will appear here as I engage with the ideas*. 

As ideas grow you may find they stay here, or I might bring them to [[The Greenhouse|The Greenhouse]] to see what they might do under particular conditions. If they get stable enough, they may get moved to [[The Grove]].

## Gardening Philosophy

Notes in the workshop are meant to evolve. They represent thinking in motion rather than fixed conclusions. They say as much by what they articulate as they do by what they form in the space of ambiguity they don't have the words for yet. Come back any time and see how my thoughts have grown.
